Identifying Recurring and Missed Payments in Bank Statements: A Graph-Based Approach
Author: Jason Young


This folder contains a research paper, code, and all support files for the author's practicum thesis for the Georgia Tech Master of Science in Computational Analytics.

To learn more about the methodology, please read the paper,  'Recurring and Missed Payment Detection Paper.pdf' file. 

To setup and run the code in an anaconda environment, follow the instructions in the /environment folder.

Code for this project is saved in 2 files:
JY_Utils.py  - contains the 2 main algorithms used, plus a variety utility functions 
Experiments.ipynb - is a jupyternotebook file demonstrating the methodology and creating visuals used in the paper

The /private folder contains all confidential data. This includes the original dataset in .csv format, a list of sampled applicants in .csv (for reproducing results), and all intermediate Excel (.xlsx) files that were used to manually evaluate the results of the algorithms.

 The /images folder contains visualization outputs of Experiments.ipynb that were used in the paper.
